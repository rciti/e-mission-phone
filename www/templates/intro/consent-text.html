<h3>What is the research study about?</h3>

You are invited to participate in this research study. The aim of this research study is to collect information about the personal travel behaviour of residents in all metropolitan areas across Australia. Information about people's day-to-day travel behaviour is critical to predict future travel demand and infrastructure needs. This information is even more important during a rare event such as the current virus pandemic. Having this data will allow transport services to be better planned for the most vulnerable people in our society, when the next pandemic comes.

<h3>Who is conducting this research?</h3>
The study is being carried out by <b>Assoc Prof Taha H. Rashidi</b> and <b>Dr Amarin Siripanich</b> at the Research Centre for Integrated Transport Innovation (RCITI), UNSW Sydney, Australia. This research is also being funded by RCITI.

<h3>Inclusion criteria</h3>
Before you decide to participate, we need to ensure that you meet the inclusion criteria of this research study. You can participate if the following criteria apply to you:

<ul>
<li>- You are eighteen years old or older.</li>
<li>- You reside in a metropolitan area of Australia.</li>
<li>- You own a smartphone running Android (compatibility varies with device) or Apple iOS 9 (or newer).</b></li>
</ul>

<h3>Do I have to take part in this research study?</h3>

Participation in any research study is voluntary. If you do not want to take part, you do not have to. If you decide that you want to take part in the research study, you will be asked:

<ul>
<li>- To read the information carefully.</li>
<li>- To participate in a four-days-long data collection with Fourstep, a location-aware travel survey mobile application.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What does participation in this research require, and are there any risks involved?</h3>
If you decide to take part in the research study, we will ask you to first complete a questionnaire. The questionnaire includes questions about your sociodemographic characteristics, your attitude towards data privacy, and your expectation of this travel survey. Fourstep is a location-aware mobile application, which automatically senses and securely stores information about your travel behaviour. Fourstep operates unobtrusively in the background and relies on your smartphone's sensors (GPS and accelerometer) to record your movements. Fourstep also requests additional information about your travel behaviour in the form of short questionnaires that are usually presented at the end of a trip. You will be asked to keep Fourstep active for four days. You will be required to always carry your smartphone on you during the study period and to assure that your smartphone's battery is always sufficiently charged. At the end of the four-days-long study period, you will need to go the â€˜Profileâ€™ tab within the Fourstep app and answer a closing closing questionnaire by clicking on the â€˜End Surveyâ€™ icon and will be asked to uninstall Fourstep.

<br>

The duration of this research study is four days. Participation in this research study is expected to require the following amounts of your personal time:
<br>
<ul>
<li>- 10 minutes to complete the opening questionnaire;</li>
<li>- 5 minutes to install the Fourstep app;</li>
<li>- Less than 1 minute to fill in questions typically prompted after completion of a trip.</li>
<li>- Less than 10 minutes to complete the closing questionnaire.</li>
</ul>
<br>

Assuming that you complete an average of four trips per day, it is expected that participation in this research study will not consume more than 41 minutes of your time during the entire study period.

All data collected through Fourstep are encrypted and securely transferred to a data server located in on the UNSW campus in Kensington, NSW. Fourstep is designed to minimise data volume usage when transferring data between your device and the server. If both WiFi and cellular network signals are available. Fourstep first uses WiFi to transmit and receive data. If WiFi is unavailable, Fourstep relies on your mobile data plan, whenever a cellular signal is available. You will not be reimbursed for any expenses related to the data usage of Fourstep. Even though Fourstep has been designed to minimise energy consumption, the continued use of location services in the background can dramatically decrease your smartphone's battery life.

We do not exepct that participation in this research study to cause any harm or discomfort. However, should you experience any feelings of distress during your participation in this study, you can let the research team know and they will provide you with assistance.

<h3>What are the possible benefits to participation?</h3>

It is hoped that the insights of this research study can inform strategic policy- making processes in the domain of transport and infrastructure planning.

<h3>What will happen to information about me?</h3>

By clicking the 'I accept' button on the Fourstep application you are providing your permission for the research team to collect and use information about you for the research study. Your data will be kept indefinitely for future research purposes. We will store information about you electronically in a non-identifiable format at secure server on the grounds of the UNSW campus in Sydney, Australia. Your information will be used to develop behavioural models of travel demand. The results of these models will only be presented in aggregate form and individual data will not be identifiable. The information for this research study may be made available to other research projects in de-identified form only. Researchers at UNSW are required to store their aggregated data in the UNSW data repository, this is a system called ResData. Once the aggregated data is deposited into this repository it will be retained in this system permanently. It will however be retained in a format where your identity will not be known.

<h3>How and when will I find out what the results of the research study are?</h3>
The research team intends to publish and report the results of the research study in a variety of ways including presentations at academic conferences and academic journal papers. Information will be published in aggregate form such that individual responses cannot be identified.

<h3>What if I want to withdraw from the research study?</h3>
If you do consent to participate, you may withdraw at any time. You can do this by closing the questionnaire or uninstalling the Fourstep mobile application from your phone. If you withdraw from the research we will destroy any information that has already been collected. However, once the data collection is complete, we will not be able to withdraw your responses as the data collection is anonymous.

<h3>What should I do if I have further questions about my involvement in the research study?</h3>
The person you may need to contact will depend on the nature of your query. If you require further information regarding this study or if you have any problems which may be related to your involvement in the study, you can contact the following members of the research team:
